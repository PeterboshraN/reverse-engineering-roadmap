# Week 1 — Reverse Engineering Foundations

This week focuses on understanding the basics of binary analysis and reverse engineering workflows.

---

# Topics Covered
- Extracting strings from binaries
- ELF file format basics
- Running binaries and understanding execution
- Command-line arguments (argc / argv)
- Static analysis using Ghidra
- Control flow understanding
- Encoding vs reversing concepts

---

# Tools Used
- strings
- file
- Ghidra

---

# Challenges Solved (picoCTF)
- strings it
- file-run1
- file-run2
- Ghidra Sleuth
- Transformation
- Reverse

# Key Learnings
- Quickly inspect binaries using Linux tools
- Identify ELF binaries and their properties
- Understand how input affects program behavior
- Analyze binaries statically to trace logic
- Differentiate between simple encoding and real reversing
