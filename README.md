# reverse-engineering-roadmap

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey in Reverse Engineering and Cybersecurity.

The roadmap focuses on:
- Understanding binary internals
- Static and dynamic analysis
- Reverse engineering real challenges
- Building strong low-level analysis skills

All learning is backed by practical challenges, tools, and write-ups.
